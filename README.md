# Tiny Compiler! 

Over my senior year winter break, I've decided to build my own compiler in an attempt to understand what goes on under the hood. I will be following along with [Nora Sandler's excellent blog post series](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html). 

I've decided go with OCaml for two reasons:
1. As mentioned in the blog post, pattern matching and sum types make implementing the compiler much easier. 
2. Using OCaml for this project will hopefully be a great foray into the world of functional programming.
